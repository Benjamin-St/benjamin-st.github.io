div(title="Image Compression")
	p Wrote a pnm image compressor which halved the size of the image with about 3% error. This was the fourth project in Comp 40 intended to teach us about bit packing and about managing complexity. This was probably one of the most complex programs I've ever written simply because of the sheer number of operations needed to be done to each 2x2 block of pixels. As the compressed image format needed to be bit packed, I also wrote a bitpack module for reading and writing ranges of bits in 64-bit words. Another aspect that made this project difficult was the subtleties in bit shifting signed vs unsigned integers on Intel machines.
