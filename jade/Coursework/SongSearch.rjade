	p.
		SongSearch is a search engine for song lyrics which I build for my Data Structures final project.
		The program finds the top ten songs in a given database of songs which contain a certain search term.
		Internally, the program uses a trie and dynamic arrays to quickly laod and search this database.

		Part of what made building this project enjoyable for me was breaking down the larger problem into smaller components which I could independently test. At the end of that day, I had an efficient, reliable, and well organized codebase (which makes me happy).
