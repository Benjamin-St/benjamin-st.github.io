div(title="Trigrams", subtitle = "Predict the language of a document")
	p Given documents of specific languages, can you figure out the language of an unlabeled document? This was the final project of the intro CS class I was TAing, so I wanted to take a stab at the problem. The program takes trigram (consecutive three letter chunks) of the labeled documents and generates a vector from the frequencies of each trigram. When encountering a document of unknown language, just generate a frequency vector and using cosine similarity to see how close the document matches the language.
	p While this project wasn't the most difficult, I found the idea of cosine similarity somewhat amazing. Taking Calc 3 at the the time, I understood the intuition of taking this dot product and came to see that machine learning isn't "magic" after all! Such a small realization made we want to pursue machine learning a little further by taking Intro to Machine Learning in the spring.
