	p.
		I made a library that lets you use GraphQL, a language for specifying what data should look like, to validae nested JS objects and arrays.

	a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-type") Here's a link to the NPM module

	p.
		Internally, the library implements a function that generates an abstract syntax tree from a GraphQL(ish) string and a function that recursively checks if an array or object matches that abstract syntax tree.
